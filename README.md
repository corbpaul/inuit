# Inuitcss base setup architecture

Base setup for using inuit.css https://github.com/inuitcss

* bower.json with all components required
* main.scss with contents and includes for all bower components

To get started use `bower install` to download the inuit.css components.

## Settings

Within the settings folder there are files for each section (i.e. base, objects etc.) These contain all the variables available within the inuit.css framework and by default are commented out.
